		<br>
		<h3><u>A Guide to Getting a Parking Pass!</u></h3>
		If you meet the criteria for parking (1. Have at least three volunteers associated with the parking pass OR 2. Signed up to receive parking instead of housing), you are eligible to receive a parking pass! 
		<br>
		Otherwise, you are welcome to go to the front desk of whichever area you are staying to purchase a parking pass at the rate of $12 per night. 
		<ul>
			<li>If you have signed up for lodging, the only way you can receive a free parking pass is through having a carpool. 
				<br>
				You must have at least three people (including yourself) in the car!
				<br>
				If you have signed up to receive a parking pass instead of lodging, your name and department is on a separate list. Be sure to have your government issued photo ID ready!
				<br>
				To list a carpool, fill in at least two other volunteers (don't put your own name here!) in the available fields on the lower left of the "Additional Information" section. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PVqxo86.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
			</li><br>
			<li>In other words, you need at least three people total. 
				<br>
				You are the <b>first person.</b>
				<br>
				Your first carpool buddy name is the <b>second person.</b>
				<br>
				Your second carpool buddy name is the <b>third person.</b>
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QNPxKol.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
			</li><br>
			<li>Note: If you want to be super awesome, we'd really appreciate groups adding a fourth person to their carpool. 
				<br>
				If only there were more space in downtown LA. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/77MDBRE.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
			</li><br>
			<li>To pick up the parking pass, make sure you have completed the above steps/complete all criteria, and go to the USC Radisson (addresses are listed at the bottom). There will be a Volunteer Resources team in the lobby available to process your parking permit. 
				<br>
				Once there, you'll be asked if you would like to park in the Radisson structure, at Cardinal Gardens, or at Century Apartments. <b>Note: These are first come first served!</b>
				<br>
				If you are purchasing a parking pass instead, please make the request to the respective front desk of where you will be staying. Individual parking passes are $12 per night at all locations.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h3><u>What to Do With That Spiffy Free Comp Code!</u></h3>
		The comp code is provided for you to GIFT a 4-day attendee badge to someone else! 
		You do NOT need to register for whoever you are gifting this code to. They are welcomed to register themselves! 
		<br>
		Do NOT use this comp code on yourself! You will be receiving a volunteer badge, which will be your pass to Anime Expo!
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>The comp code is also located in the "Additional Information" section on Shiftboard!</li>
			<li>Go to the upper right portion of the "Additional Information" section, and copy the code listed there!
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GXYNPLW.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
			</li><br>
			<li>Now go to the AX Website's registration page: <a href="https://www.anime-expo.org/register/" target="_blank">www.anime-expo.org/register</a>
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XZId7x6.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
			</li><br>
			<li>Scroll down to the 4-Day Attendee Section and select "Register Now"
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/emL5rHm.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
			</li><br>
			<li>This will bring you to the EventBrite page for AX 2018!
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/egoBldY.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
			</li><br>
			<li>Scroll to the bottom of the listings of badges. There, you will find a little clickable link that says "Enter Promotional Code." Click that link!
				<br>
				<b>NOTE: AT NO POINT DO YOU EVER NEED TO ENTER ANY PAYMENT INFORMATION</b>
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fjIPGwN.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
			</li><br>
			<li>Once you click that link, a text field will appear where you can enter the promotional comp code from your Shiftboard profile. Enter that code there and select "Apply."
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nbZW9Cr.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
			</li><br>
			<li>After entering a code, there will be the option to select a 4-Day attendee badge that costs $0.00
				<br>
				Select that option and proceed with the registration process as normal. 
				<br>
				<b>NOTE: Again, unless you are purchasing additional badges besides the complimentary 4-Day badge, you will not need to enter any payment information at any point!</b>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br>

			<li>If you are arriving AFTER Day 0 (July 4), you will need to TEXT the VR hotline at (424)261-2977 upon arrival as operations at the USC Dorms ends at 9PM on Day 0
				<br>

		<ul>
			<li>BE SURE TO HAVE YOUR GOVERNMENT ISSUED (NOT EXPIRED) PHOTO ID WITH YOU!</li>
			<li><b>THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS GET YOUR BADGE!</b> Visit VR at the USC Radisson to pick up your badge! You cannot get into the LACC without that badge!</li>
			<li>Once you have that badge, check in with your department manager/direct supervisor accordingly!</li>

			<li>You can check in at the Radisson starting at: 4PM on the day you are slated to arrive!</li>
			<li>On the day you are expected to check out of your lodging, you must check out by <b>noon.</b></li>
			<li>Volunteers can use the priority entrances for South Hall and West Hall the LACC! (See: Blue entrances below)
				<br>

		<h3><u>Where to find the shuttles!</u></h3>
		It's about 1.7 miles between the volunteer lodging and the LACC. But, there's a volunteer shuttle available 24 hours that will take you between all of these locations! Please note that in the morning, that is when all of your volunteer peers will also be making their way to the LACC from the lodging locations. The number of shuttles available in the morning has increased, but please prepare ample time to make it to your first shift!
		<br>
